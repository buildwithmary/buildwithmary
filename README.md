# 👋 Hi, I’m @buildwithmary

I'm a full-stack software engineer and the founder of **Centrali**, a data platform for modern teams to manage structures, records, compute, and automation at scale. I specialize in designing scalable backend systems, secure authentication flows, and developer-friendly APIs.

---

### 👀 I’m interested in
- Building microservice architectures that *just work*
- Open standards like OIDC, OAuth2, and OpenTelemetry
- Developer UX (from API playgrounds to system notices)
- AI-augmented dev tools and content editors
- Self-hostable, privacy-conscious infrastructure
- Making debugging less painful

---

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Real-time data processing pipelines
- Usage-based billing models with Stripe integration
- Deep integrations with OpenTelemetry for tracing and logging
- Better UI/UX patterns with Ant Design, Recoil, and React

---

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- Self-hosted SaaS infrastructure and dev tools
- TypeScript-heavy Node.js backends (Knex, Fastify, etc.)
- Authentication systems with custom OIDC flows
- Open-source UI kits for internal tooling

### ⚡ Fun fact
I built a full identity platform *twice* — once with Keycloak and once from scratch. Guess which one I’m still using? 😅
